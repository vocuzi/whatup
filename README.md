## Sending a Template Messages

Here how to send a pre-approved template message;

```python
>>> messenger.send_template("hello_world", "255757xxxxxx")
```

## Webhook

Webhook are useful incase you're wondering how to respond to incoming message send by user, but I have created a [starter webhook](https://github.com/Neurotech-HQ/heyoo/blob/main/hook.py) which you can then customize it according to your own plans.

Incase you want a hustle free automatic deployment of the webhook to the Heroku platform, then we have made it simpler for you. With Just a click of a button you can deploy your webhook to Heroku.

## steps
1. Click the deploy button and the Heroku webpage will open for authentication, after authentication sit back and relax for deployment to finish.
                             [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/JAXPARROW/whatsapi-flask-webhook)

2. From Heroku settings configure your Environment varibles of your WhatsAapp application.
3. Setup and verify your webhook url and token then subscribe to messages.

To learn more about webhook and how to configure in your Facebook developer dashboard please [have a look here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/set-up-webhooks).
